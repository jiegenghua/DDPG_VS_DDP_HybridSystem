# DDPG_VS_DDP_HybridSystem
## This repo holds all the data and code of the following project: "Finite Horizon Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Method in Solving Optimal Control of State-Dependent Switched Systems".
## There are three environments: multiple region, multiple region with switched stage cost, and sea model
## The DDP algorithm is the widely used one, while here we added an event detection for the algorithm to be aware of the switch of the dynamics and stage cost.
### For the DDPG, if you are using the Ubuntu system, just run the code with the following command.
```python train_DDPG.py'''
